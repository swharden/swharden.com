# About Scott

**I'm Scott W Harden, and this is my personal website.** I use this space to share personal projects I work on and as a place to aggregate notes and documentation I collect along the way. My formal education is in molecular biology, dentistry, and neuroscience, but I am passionate about computer programming and electrical engineering.

## Medical Updates

**I was diagnosed with cancer** in 2012 ([peripheral T-cell lymphoma](https://lymphoma.org/aboutlymphoma/nhl/ptcl/)) and began treatments in 2018 including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and an autologous bone marrow transplant. My medical updates are chronicled on [swharden.com/med](https://www.swharden.com/med/)

As of the time of writing (early 2021) I am still doing well, but the future of my disease remains somewhat uncertain. If this website hasn't been updated in a while, you can verify that I'm doing well by seeing [recent activity on GitHub](https://github.com/swharden).
