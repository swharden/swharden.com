# Scott W Harden

**I'm a biological research scientist passionate about public collaborative hardware and software development.** This website highlights of some of the projects I work on and serves as a useful place for me to aggregate notes and documentation I collect along the way. Although most projects here are motivated purely by personal interest, I occasionally accept [commission](https://tech.swharden.com/) to develop custom software and/or hardware solutions to meet specific needs.
